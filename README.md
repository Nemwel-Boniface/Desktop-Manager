# Desktop-Manager
When using the Desktop manager app, It comes with a save.txt file that acts as your database that stores the path to the .exe of the applications that you want to open all at once.
To use the application click the open file button which will open the file explorer. It will only show you the executable files (.exe). Once you've selected the .exe of the apps you want to open all at once click on the run apps button and all of the applications you've chosen to be run will open.
The save.txt then will save the file paths so when you close and restart the application you will still be able to re-run the applications.
